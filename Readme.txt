The experiment uses a within-subject design with one session to investigate participants' choices. 

The behavioral measurement contains three parts. In the first part, two tasks will be administered: In the first task, willingness to pay (WTP), 
participants will see pictures of toys one by one and indicate how much they are willing to pay for the presented toy on a continuous scale. 
In the second task, the binary choice task, pictures of toys will be shown one by one, and participants will choose whether they want to have the presented toy.

Afterward, participants will take part in several attentional tasks, where they need to respond to the toys based on instructions. 
There are two tasks here; in one, participants must approach or avoid shown toys based on a presented sound (i.e., high versus low-pitch). 
In the other task, participants must categorize emotional pictures as quickly as possible. 

Finally, in the third part of the experiment, participants will take part in the two tasks they had during the first section 
(i.e., willingness to pay and binary choice), plus a third task. The third task will be a competitive choice task, 
where two options are presented, and participants can choose only one.

PLEASE BE AWARE: The study contains several attention checks and attention tasks.

PLEASE BE AWARE: During the experiment, you cannot be unresponsive for more than 3 minutes. Otherwise, the tasks will end automatically.
